# GitHub Repo Finder

Github repo finder helps user to find the repository available in Github.

You can search for repositories like: javascript, java, react, vue etc.

Adding to the features, there is pagination to visit through various results.

You can click on the heading of the displayed repository and it will take you to the page with various information about it. While you are in that page, you can visit either the original repo or the owner's profile.

## What have I used

1. I have used [React](https://reactjs.org/) as JavaScript Framework.

2. To get the repo results, I have used [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)
   <br/>
3. For formatting time on the search result, I have used npm package called, [JavaScriptTimeAgo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/javascript-time-ago)
